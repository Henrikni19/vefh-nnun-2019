                <h3>What is Rocket League</h3> 
                <p>
                    Rocket League combines soccer with driving in an unbelievable physics-based multiplayer-focused sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars! Choose from a variety of high-flying vehicles equipped with huge rocket boosters to score amazing aerial goals and pull off incredible, game-changing saves!

                <h3>Why I like the game</h3> Rocket League is based on how good your reflexes and coordinations are, there are so many possible ways to score, save or even pass to your team-mate, there can be up to 4 people in a team but it gets messy when there are that many people playing in the same match, i'd prefer to play 3v3 or 2v2.
